Manual

* Clone the repository

* To run unit tests:

**  bundle exec rspec -> Included all possible model specs & request specs

* Have added complete API documentation here : https://docs.google.com/document/d/16y-aA8Frs0vGSQW0ts6dUC4vjd3ySXER4ocSbKND3Xg/edit

** All basic logic lies in companies_controller.rb & company.rb, tried to achieve all basic scenarios and used database to manage the scenarios and also written as an API to interact with the backend server.
